This project collects and (will later analyse) weather data for the Auckland
region.

weather.db    -- A blank SQLite database to log data with.

weather.py    -- The script that logs data from the Metservice JSON
                 webservice. This script works for Python 2.5, originally I
                 worked on a version for Python 2.6, but the only major
                 difference is the 2.5 version not using the 'with' statement.

weather.sql   -- A file detailing the schema of the database.
